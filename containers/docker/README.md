|   | **Extension** | **Description** |
| - | ------------- | --------------- | 
|   | [drone CLI](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/drone/drone-ci-docker-extension) | lets you do continuous integration from your laptop |
|   | [Disk Usage](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/docker/disk-usage-extension) | Helps developers understand docker disk usage | 
|   | [vcluster](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/loftsh/vcluster-dd-extension) | Create virtual clusters on top of any Kubernetes cluster. Instead of creating full-blown clusters that might just shoot up your cloud bill, the vclusters are cheap, with the added advantages of multi-tenancy. |

|   | [Snyk](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-docker-desktop-extension) | A developer security tool that helps developers discover vulnerabilities with their images and warn them of the associated risks. | 
|   | [JFrog Xray Scan](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-docker-desktop-extension) | Scan your images for vulnerabilities. | 
|   | [okteto](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/okteto/docker-desktop-extension) | |
